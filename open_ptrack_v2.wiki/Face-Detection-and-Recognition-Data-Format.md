This is an example of face detection and recognition's data format:

```json 
{
   "header": {
       "seq": 71251,
       "stamp": {
           "sec": 1415305737,
           "nsec": 110138944
       },
       "frame_id": "world"
   },
   "tracks": [{
       "id": 387,
       "stable_id": 1147,
       "face_name":  "Sam",
       "x": -0.89131,
       "y": 2.41851,
       "height": 1.55837,
       "age": 29.471,
       "confidence": 0.0500193
   }]
}
```

 - ```ID``` is the unique identification associated with the track. 
 - ```stable_id``` is the stable ID for this track, generated by OpenFace's face recognition (i.e. once recognized, a person will get stable ID for the lifetime of OpenPTrack session)
 - ```face_name``` is the name of the identified closest matching face, from faces trained into the system using the [drag and drop people registration tool](https://github.com/OpenPTrack/open_ptrack_v2/wiki/Face-Parameters#drag-and-drop-tool-for-face-recognition) 
 - Units for ```x```, ```y```, and ```height``` are meters, which is true across all the other JSON message types provided in OpenPTrack. 
 - ```age``` is how long that ID has been active for.
 - ```confidence``` represents the system's calculation of how reliable the track is. It refers to the OpenPTrack tracking confidence, and is unrelated to face detection/tracking. 

**N.B.:** The packet replaces the OpenPTrack packet and is sent to the same port.
